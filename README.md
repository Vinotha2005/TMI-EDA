# ðŸš€ AI Workforce Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes a customer/employee dataset to extract insights using the data science workflow.

It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), probability, linear algebra, calculus, and feature engineering to demonstrate how core concepts of mathematics and statistics power machine learning and

business analytics.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Dataset

Source: customer_data.csv / workforce dataset

Key Features (example):

customer_id / employee_id â†’ Unique identifier

full_name â†’ Name of the person

age / experience_years â†’ Numerical feature

annual_income / salary â†’ Continuous value

spending_score / role â†’ Score or category

city / department â†’ Categorical attribute

transactions / last_purchase_days â†’ Activity/engagement

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights

1.Part A â€“ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

Converted categorical fields into standardized formats.

ðŸ”¹ Part B â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of income, experience, and spending/salary.

Histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to reveal outliers and trends.

Correlation heatmaps to show relationships between features.

ðŸ”¹ Part C â€“ Probability

Computed probabilities for high-spending or high-salary groups.

Estimated likelihood of ROI > threshold.

Showed real-world use cases for probability in customer segmentation.

ðŸ”¹ Part D â€“ Linear Algebra

Used matrix operations with NumPy for feature transformations.

Demonstrated how linear algebra underlies ML models.

ðŸ”¹ Part E â€“ Calculus

Applied Sympy to differentiate functions related to salary/income.

Showed how derivatives explain trends in growth and diminishing returns.

ðŸ”¹ Part F â€“ Feature Engineering

Created new features such as ROI (Return on Investment), income brackets, and recency-based variables.

Prepared the dataset for machine learning models.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sympy jupyter

Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook AI_WORKFORCE_PROJECT.ipynb


## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion & Insights

Income/Salary vs Experience â†’ Generally positive correlation, but not perfectly linear.

Probability & Segmentation â†’ Useful to identify high-value groups.

Mathematics in Action â†’ Linear algebra and calculus explain the mechanics behind feature transformations and growth trends.

Feature Engineering â†’ ROI and engagement features give deeper insights for decision-making



## âœ… Business Takeaways

Segment customers/employees into meaningful groups for targeting.

Identify high ROI individuals for promotion, retention, or campaigns.

Use math/statistics to power data-driven strategies.

Prepare the dataset for ML applications like prediction and clustering.
